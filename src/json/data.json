        "It is the sixth studio album by British progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in October 1971. It was recorded in several recording studios in the London area, including Abbey Road Studios. Without new material to work with and without having a clear idea of the direction they wanted the album to take, the band developed a series of novel experiments that finally served as inspiration for the best known track on the album, &#34;Echoes.&#34; Although many of the group's subsequent albums focused on a unique theme with lyrics written mostly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member.",
        "It was recorded and produced from January to August 1971 among the obligations of the tours. The reviews of music critics were relatively good for this work. The disc was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, however, in the USA. The mediocre publicity of his American distributor led him to be a sales failure in that country."
