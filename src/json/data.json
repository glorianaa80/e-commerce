        "The album, although showing the development of the talents of the group's composers, maintained the structure of songs and instrumentation of basic rock and roll. It was the first album of the group to contain only original compositions and the only one in which the musical catalog was signed entirely by Lennon-McCartney. Normally, Paul McCartney and John Lennon contribute equally with their songs in the making of each album of The Beatles, but in A Hard Day's Night Lennon's authorship in the composition of the songs was predominant, being responsible for the majority of the thirteen songs that were presented on this album."

It was recorded in several recording studios in the London area, including Abbey Road Studios. Without new material to work with and without having a clear idea of the direction they wanted the album to take, the band developed a series of novel experiments that finally served as inspiration for the best known track on the album, &#34;Echoes.&#34; Although many of the group's subsequent albums focused on a unique theme with lyrics written mostly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member.",

The disc was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, however, in the USA. The mediocre publicity of his American distributor led him to be a sales failure in that country."
